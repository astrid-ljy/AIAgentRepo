- Required changes clearly listed
- Decision made (Approve/Revise/Block)
- Multiple turns shown if needed

#### 2. **SQL Display** 📝
Beautiful formatted display of approved SQL:
- Syntax highlighting
- Source tables identified
- CTEs explicitly shown
- Validation status

#### 3. **Review Phase Dialogue** ⚖️
See Judge reviewing the results:

- Data validation
- Issues identified (if any)
- Final verdict

## Visual Example

### Before (Old Dialogue):
```
Planning Phase: AM ↔ DS Negotiation
Consensus reached
Total turns: 1
```

**Problem:** Too vague! What was discussed?

### After (New Dialogue):
```
💬 Planning Phase: AM ↔ DS Negotiation

🔵 Turn 1: DS Proposes

Goal: Find the game with highest number of reviews

SQL:
```sql
WITH recent_reviews AS (
    SELECT game_id, COUNT(*) AS review_count
    FROM games_reviews
    WHERE review_date >= MAX(review_date) - INTERVAL '3 months'
    GROUP BY game_id
)
SELECT g.game_name, r.review_count
FROM recent_reviews r
JOIN games_info g ON r.game_id = g.game_id
ORDER BY r.review_count DESC LIMIT 1
```

Risk Flags: Complex CTE with subquery

🟠 Turn 1: AM Reviews

Decision: ✅ APPROVE

Reasons:
  - SQL structure correct
  - Proper use of CTE for readability
  - Correct aggregation and joining
  - Historical data handling appropriate

✅ Result: Consensus Reached
Total turns: 1
```

**Solution:** Complete transparency!

```

```
User: "Calculate customer lifetime value"

🔵 DS Proposes: SUM(price) GROUP BY customer
🟠 AM Reviews: 🔄 REVISE (need to check refunds, time period)

🔵 DS Proposes: [Revised with refunds, date filter]
🟠 AM Reviews: ✅ APPROVE
```

### Edge Case (With Warnings)
```
User: "Show products with zero sales"
